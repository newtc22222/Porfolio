# Introduce

This portfolio repository highlights a selection of my projects, demonstrating my expertise in full-stack development. It features web applications built with **React**, **Redux**, and **Spring Boot**, integrating **MySQL** for database management and secure authentication using **JWT**. Each project showcases different aspects of my skills, from `front-end` design to `back-end` architecture.

The portfolio is continuously updated with new projects and refinements. Contributions and feedback are always appreciated!
